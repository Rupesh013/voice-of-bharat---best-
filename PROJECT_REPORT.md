## CHAPTER 1: SYSTEM ANALYSIS

### 1.1 Proposed System
The proposed system is a modern, single-page application (SPA) built using React and TypeScript. It is designed to be responsive, accessible, and performant across all devices.

**Key components of the system include:**
1.  **Frontend:** A client-side application built with React that handles all user interactions and UI rendering. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling and React Router for navigation.
2.  **AI Integration:** The core intelligence is powered by Google's Gemini API (`@google/genai` SDK). This is used for a wide range of tasks, from natural language processing for the chat assistants and voice control to complex JSON generation for features like career roadmaps and crop diagnosis.
3.  **State Management:** React Context API is used for managing global state such as user profile information and language preferences.
4.  **Internationalization (i18n):** The system is built to be multilingual, with a custom `useTranslation` hook that fetches strings from locale files.

The architecture is serverless from the user's perspective, with all AI computations handled by the external Gemini API, ensuring scalability and reducing backend maintenance.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
Despite India's rapid digitization, a significant portion of its citizens face barriers in accessing digital services. The key problems this project aims to solve are:
-   **Information Overload & Fragmentation:** Government schemes and services are spread across numerous websites with complex jargon, making it difficult for citizens to find what they need.
-   **Digital Literacy Gap:** Many individuals lack the skills to navigate complex web portals, fill out forms, or use digital tools effectively.
-   **Language Barriers:** The majority of digital content is in English, excluding a large non-English-speaking population.
-   **Lack of Personalized Guidance:** Generic portals do not cater to the specific needs of different demographic groups like farmers or students.
-   **Reactive Service Model:** Users are expected to actively search for information. There is a lack of proactive systems that can alert users to relevant opportunities or risks based on their profile.

"Voice of Bharat" addresses these issues by providing a unified, personalized, accessible, and proactive platform.

## CHAPTER 3: TESTING

A multi-layered testing strategy is envisioned to ensure the application's quality, reliability, and usability.

### 3.1 Unit Testing
Each individual component (e.g., `Button`, `Card`, `Input`) and utility function would be tested in isolation using a framework like Jest and React Testing Library. This ensures that the smallest parts of the application work as expected.
-   **Example:** Test that the `SectionCard` component renders the correct title and links to the correct path.

### 3.2 Integration Testing
Integration tests would focus on the interactions between different components. This verifies that combined parts of the application function correctly together.
-   **Example:** Test the entire "Fertilizer Optimizer" form. This would involve simulating user input, form submission, the call to the mock `geminiService`, and verifying that the results are displayed correctly.

### 3.3 System Testing
End-to-end (E2E) testing would simulate a full user journey through the application using a tool like Cypress or Playwright. This ensures that critical user flows work seamlessly from start to finish.
-   **Example:** A test script would navigate to the homepage, click on the "Students" section, navigate to the "Resume Builder," interact with the AI features, and verify that a resume can be downloaded.
